# Git Situation

Last updated: 2026-06-19

## Fixed Locally

- Global git identity is set to `jarredsimpkins-bot`.
- Global git email is set to `286102097+jarredsimpkins-bot@users.noreply.github.com`.
- Default branch for new repositories is set to `main`.
- Git credential helper is set to `manager`.

## Active Local Repositories

| Repo | Path | Remote Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CERTAHEALTH | `C:\Users\SimpS\OneDrive\Documents\CERTAHEALTH` | `origin` -> `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/CERTASURV.git` |
| CERTARD | `C:\Users\SimpS\OneDrive\Documents\CERTARD` | `origin` -> `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/certard.git` |
| MACROTBC | `C:\Users\SimpS\OneDrive\Documents\MACROTBC` | `origin` -> `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/macrotbc.git` |
| AUTOMATIONS | `C:\Users\SimpS\OneDrive\Documents\AUTOMATIONS` | `origin` -> `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/certasurv-automations.git` |
| CERTASURV_WEB_APP | `C:\Users\SimpS\OneDrive\Documents\CERTASURV_WEB_APP` | `origin` -> `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/certasurv-web-app.git` |

## Planned Remote Names

| Local Repo | GitHub Remote |
| --- | --- |
| CERTAHEALTH | `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/certahealth.git` |
| CERTARD | `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/certard.git` |
| MACROTBC | `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/macrotbc.git` |
| AUTOMATIONS | `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/certasurv-automations.git` |
| CERTASURV_WEB_APP | `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/certasurv-web-app.git` |

`CERTASURV` is public and reachable. The planned `certahealth.git` destination currently returns `repository not found`, so the control-repo cutover target is not actually provisioned yet. The remaining launch support repositories listed above are in active use locally.

## Current Release-Ops Notes

- `CERTAHEALTH` currently pushes to public `CERTASURV.git`, but the planned dedicated target remains `certahealth.git` and is not reachable as of June 19, 2026.
- `CERTASURV_WEB_APP` is the active local workspace name; any lingering `New project2` references should be treated as legacy docs only.
- GitHub CLI is installed locally and still unauthenticated on this host as of June 19, 2026, so private-repo workflow inspection still requires `gh auth login`.
