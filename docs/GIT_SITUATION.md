## Active Local Repositories

| Repo | Path | Remote Status |

## Planned Remote Names

| Local Repo | GitHub Remote |
| --- | --- |
| CERTAHEALTH | `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/certahealth.git` |
| CERTARD | `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/certard.git` |
| MACROTBC | `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/macrotbc.git` |
| AUTOMATIONS | `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/certasurv-automations.git` |
| CERTASURV_WEB_APP | `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/certasurv-web-app.git` |
| WV_COURTHOUSE_RESEARCHER | `https://github.com/jarredsimpkins-bot/wv-courthouse-researcher.git` |

All planned repositories except WV_COURTHOUSE_RESEARCHER are confirmed to exist. `CERTASURV` is public; the remaining launch support repositories are private.

## Current Release-Ops Notes

- `CERTAHEALTH` currently pushes to public `CERTASURV.git`, but the planned dedicated target remains `certahealth.git`.
- `CERTASURV_WEB_APP` is the active local workspace name; any lingering `New project2` references should be treated as legacy docs only.
- GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated locally as `jarredsimpkins-bot` with `repo` scope during the June 24, 2026 release-ops pass.
- `MACROTBC` remains a release blocker until the local modified command usage log is reviewed and committed or explicitly left out.
- `WV_COURTHOUSE_RESEARCHER` remains a release blocker until the remote/repository is created or confirmed and the current local runbook/toolkit edits are triaged.
