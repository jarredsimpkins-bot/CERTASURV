# Cloud Processing Plan

Last updated: 2026-05-22

## What Moves To Cloud

| Work | Cloud Target | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python app tests for `New project2` | GitHub Actions | Keeps dependency install and pytest load off the laptop |
| PowerShell syntax checks for control/TBC scripts | GitHub Actions on Windows runners | Catches broken scripts without touching local production |
| JSON/config validation for command-center and Drive automation packages | GitHub Actions | Verifies package integrity before handoff |
| Drive file routing and scraper jobs | Google Apps Script triggers | Runs near Drive data instead of depending on laptop uptime |
| Shared-drive package artifacts | GitHub Actions artifacts after push | Gives downloadable release packages outside OneDrive |

## What Stays Local

| Work | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Live TBC/Trimble macro execution | Requires installed Trimble Business Center and local user session |
| Google Drive Desktop mounting | Requires signed-in desktop client and local drive letter |
| Laptop load/process management | Controls this physical machine |

## Adaptive Rule

`CERTA Laptop Load Manager` now runs in `Auto` mode every minute. If TBC/Trimble is active, local priority shifts to TBC and nonessential browser/Codex/helper work is parked. If TBC is not active, local dev helpers are allowed back to normal priority. `CERTA Cloud Offload Runner` checks every 10 minutes and pushes already-committed branches once Git remotes and Git Credential Manager access are available.

## Activation Gate

The workflows are prepared locally and pushed to GitHub. They run on each pushed repo/branch:

1. `CERTASURV` / `CERTAHEALTH`: public control repo, `main`.
2. `certard`: private coordination repo, `main`.
3. `macrotbc`: private TBC production integration repo, `codex/certasurv-command-center`.
4. `certasurv-automations`: private Drive/AppScript automation repo, `codex/onboard-everything`.
5. `certasurv-web-app`: private app/dashboard repo, `codex/land-opportunity-radar-mvp`.

The cloud offload runner pushes committed branches every 10 minutes. It intentionally does not auto-stage or auto-commit live work.
